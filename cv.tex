\section*{Biography}

Stephen is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the
University of Kentucky, where he directs the Narrative Intelligence Lab and
teaches courses on artificial intelligence and game development.

He uses AI to model interactive stories in virtual environments like video
games and training simulations. Virtual reality experiences are more effective
when the simulated characters adapt to accommodate the player’s choices. Stephen
works on strong story narrative planning systems (contrasted with emergent
story systems) which quickly consider millions of hypothetical futures to find
optimal stories given the experience designer’s aesthetic and pedagogic goals.

His work has earned six best paper awards and been nominated for two more.
Since 2014, he has participated in over \$3 million in sponsored federal, state,
and local research, including a CAREER award from the U.S. National Science
Foundation. He has published over 50 peer-reviewed papers. According to Google
Scholar, his h-index is 17 and his work receives over 120 citations a year. He
referees for the {\em IEEE Transactions on Games} journal and has served as an
organizer or program committee member for top conferences in his field,
including AIIDE, CoG, IVA, ICIDS, FDG, AAAI, and IJCAI.
